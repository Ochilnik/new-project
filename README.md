# Instructions for Creating a New GitHub Repository

To create a new GitHub repository for 'new-project' and a development branch, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your GitHub account.

2. Click on the '+' (plus) sign in the top right corner and select 'New repository'.

3. Fill in the repository name as 'new-project'.

4. Optionally, provide a description for your repository.

5. Choose the repository visibility (public or private).

6. Initialize this repository with a README.

7. Click 'Create repository'.

8. Now, your GitHub repository is created with a README file. You can start working on your project by creating a development branch.

To create a development branch:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.

2. Click on the 'Branch: main' button and type in the branch name 'development'.

3. Click 'Create branch'.

You now have a development branch where you can work on new features without affecting the main branch.

Happy coding!
